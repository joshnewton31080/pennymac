# PennyMac React coding test

I attempted to utilize, for the first time, [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/
) for styling.

It is a popular CSS-in-JS component library that makes styling React apps with accessibility, responsiveness, custom themes and light/dark modes.

I've been wanting to try it so I studied the Chakra docs for a while, felt confident, and decided to use it in this effort, hoping to impress myself and you.

Unfortunately it did slow me down significantly and I did not complete everthing I wanted to implement in spite of spending more like 6 hours.

My app has the show search capabilities but does not show episodes. I added a modal if you click a show in the list.

I added some extra controls to demonstrate and test some of the Chakra features, such as changing light/dark modes and other features. Dark mode needs work.

I would have done more refactoring (SearchBox is too big) and added unit tests using Jest and react-testing-utils. The responsiveness needs work.

I, of course, realize now that starting a timed coding test with a new technology was risky. In my experience when picking up new tools and technologies 1 or 2 people should spend the time to master it, then present the subject, and a working model, to the rest of the team and stakeholders.

If I could start this coding test knowing what I now know of Chakra-UI, I'm confident I would have all the features including responsiveness for phones, tablets and desktop, light/dark modes, etc.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to interview and try the test. I hope you can find a spot for me there where I can help you out.

Thanks!
